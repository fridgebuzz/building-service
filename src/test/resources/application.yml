# This configuration file defines Spring Boot and Building-Service default settings
#
# Whenever the integration with Consul KV is enabled,
# Building-Service default settings are overridden by the values provided by Consul KV.
#
# Spring boot will only override default application settings that are existent
# in both forms (building-service.yml and Consul KV). In this way, if a particular setting
# is not existent in Consul KV, Spring boot will use the default one.
